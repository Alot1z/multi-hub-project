# Multi-Hub Platform

üè≠ AI-driven DevOps platform for iOS, 3D Printing, Games & More

## How It Works

This public repository contains only the secure launcher system:

### üîí Security Flow:
1. **index.html** - Main launcher with security checks
2. **platform.txt** - Contains only base URL + private repo link
3. **Security verification** - Only Alot1z.github.io can access full system
4. **Private repo integration** - Loads all Netlify URLs securely

### üöÄ Integration Process:
1. User visits Alot1z.github.io
2. Launcher reads public platform.txt
3. Security check verifies base URL match
4. Loads private repo platform.txt via raw GitHub
5. Double verification of base URLs
6. Redirects to main hub-ui platform
7. Hub-ui loads all subproject URLs securely

### üì± Available Platforms:
- **iOS App Builder** - TrollStore compatible apps
- **3D Printer Builder** - OpenSCAD model generation
- **Game Builder** - iOS game development
- **AI Models** - Local AI management

All platforms are loaded via secure iframe integration with cross-origin verification.

## Access
